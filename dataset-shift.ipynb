    "# Dataset shift\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous assignment you have worked with wafer map data from a semiconductor manufacturing process, and developed a calibrated binary classifier for identifying whether a finished wafer contains a known pattern of faulty chips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the company has evaluated several classifiers and deployed one of them in production, as part of a larger system for identifying the root causes of faulty chips. The root cause analysis relies on the expertise of human operators. When the root cause of faulty chips on a wafer can be identified, the process parameters can be adjusted, reducing the number of faulty chips and increasing wafer yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the company would like all wafers to be analyzed by the operators, however, their capacity is limited. Therefore, the classifier is used as part of a filtering stage to select wafers for further analysis by the operators, based on whether the wafers contain a known pattern of faulty chips.\n",
    "\n",
    "One month after deploying the classifier, the company observes degrading wafer yield. They think it is due to a drop in classification performance of the classifier: misclassifying wafers that are suitable for further analysis will prevent the operators from identifying the root causes of faulty chips and adapting the process parameters, resulting in more faults and lower yield. They suspect it may be related to a recent change of a process parameter at one of the manufacturing stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given three datasets:\n",
    "- a labeled *training* set that represents the data used to train the classifier,\n",
    "- a partially labeled *production* set representing the data collected after the model was deployed in production.\n",
    "- an unlabeled *leaderboard* set representing the data collected after the *production* set.\n",
    "\n",
    "All datasets are based on the WM-811K dataset containing annotated wafer maps collected from real-world fabrication (see `./data/readme.txt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also given the implementation of the deployed classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to check if a distribution shift may have caused the deployed classifier to drop in predictive performance, and to improve the predictive performance of the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook you will find cells starting with `# // BEGIN_TODO` and `# // END_TODO` tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fill in all your code between these `# // BEGIN_TODO` and `# // END_TODO` tags.\n",
    "- Do not edit these tags in any way, or else your answers may not be processed by the grading system.\n",
    "- You can add as many code and text cells as you want between the `# // BEGIN_TODO` and `# // END_TODO` tags to make your code nicely readable.\n",
    "- You are free to use any libraries listed in the Hints section on Canvas, but make sure you import all your libraries between the `# // BEGIN_TODO` and `# // END_TODO` tags.\n",
